<h2 style="color: blue">User Interface</h2>

The main user interface of AEE is categorized into a number of pages, and are

<h3 style="color: blue">1. Installed Apps</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>This page will by default load all the installed application on your device. AEE also allow offers a separate view of <b>System</b> and <b>User</b> apps. The following tasks are allowed on this page.</tab1></p>

<ol>
    <li>Single click on an icon will load it in full screen. From the newly opened screen, it is also possible to save the same into device storage.</li>
    <li>Single click on any other part of an application will open the contents of the installed application in a File Manager and allows users to navigate through its contents.</li>
    <li>It is possible to <b>Save</b>/<b>Export</b> individual resource files such as fonts, graphics, binary XML files, etc to device storage.</li>
    <li>AEE even allow users to <b>Delete</b> or <b>Replace</b> original resource files of an APK.</li>
    <li>It is also possible to edit text/binary files using an in-built text editor. However, AEE binary text editor is very basic and a little buggy. As a result, text editing is disabled by default in the <b>Settings</b> menu of the app.</li>
    <li>Finally, AEE offers the generation of a signed (with AEE custom key) APKs/App Bundles after the above-mentioned modifications.</li>
    <li>Alternately, long clicking on an entry on the main screen will allow users to simply export (with or without signing with AEE custom key) APKs/App bundles into device storage.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="color: blue">2. Projects</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>This page lists all the applications (including the uninstalled ones) that are already explored from the first page, provided the user decided to retain the explored data upon asking (app will prompt when closing a project). This page also allows almost all the tasks that are available in the previous page. Additionally, long-clicking an item on this page will allow making a copy of the entire project folder of the selected app into device storage.</tab1></p>

<h3 style="color: blue">3. Extracted APKs</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>This page lists all the APKs/App bundles created on the first page. Various tasks that are allowed on this page are</tab1></p>

<ol>
    <li>Install an exported APK/Split APKs by single clicking.</li>
    <li>Share an exported APK/Split APKs by long clicking.</li>
    <li>Delete an exported APK/Split APKs.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Additionally, this page is also equipped with a feature-rich APK/Split APK/App bundle installer.

<h3 style="color: blue">4. About</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Shows very basic information about the development of this project. It includes links to visit the source code of AEE, Telegram support group etc.</tab1></p>

<h3 style="color: blue">5. Settings</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>The <b>Settings</b> menu of AEE is bundled with a number of options that are designed to ease the use of the app.</tab1></p>

<h2 style="color: blue">APK Signing</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>AEE will recognize APK files and app bundles and sign them accordingly with its default key. In order to sign an APK using a custom Keystore, some specific methods need to be followed and are explained in the next section.</tab1></p>

<h2 style="color: blue">Signing with a custom key</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>In order to sign APKs with a custom key, AEE requires a <b>private key</b> in pk8 format as well as an <b>X509Certificate</b> exported from the same key.</tab1></p>

<h3 style="color: blue">How to create private key</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Convert a java keystore (JKS) to PKCS12 format<br><br><b>keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore KEYSTORE_PATH -destkeystore intermediate.p12 -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12</b><br><br></li>
    <li>Convert a PKCS12 to pem format<br><br><b>openssl pkcs12 -in intermediate.p12 -nodes -out intermediate.rsa.pem</b><br><br></li>
    <li>Finally convert pem to pk8 format<br><br><b>openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -outform DER -in intermediate.rsa.pem -inform PEM -out private.pk8 -nocrypt</b><br></li>
</ol>

<h3 style="color: blue">How to create X509Certificate</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Read X509Certificate from a java keystore (JKS)<br><br><b>keytool -list -rfc -keystore KEYSTORE_PATH -alias KEY_ALIAS -storepass STORE_PASSWORD</b><br><br></li>
    <li>From the output, copy the text starting from <b>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</b> to <b>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</b> (including both) and save it as a text file<br><br></li>
</ol>

<h3 style="color: blue">Configure AEE to work with custom key</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Open AEE and Navigate to <b>Settings -> Sign APKs with</b> and select <b>Custom Key</b>. A new page will now open which allows users to select a custom <b>Private Key</b> and <b>X509Certificate</b>. Use it! By doing so, AEE will do the following changes, and now onwards uses the new credentials for signing.</tab1></p>

<ol>
    <li>Save private key as<br><br><b>/data/data/com.apk.editor/files/signing/APKEditor.pk8</b><br><br></li>
    <li>Save X509Certificate as<br><br><b>/data/data/com.apk.editor/files/signing/APKEditorCert</b><br><br></li>
</ol>
