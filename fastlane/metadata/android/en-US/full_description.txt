<b>APK Explorer & Editor</b> (AEE) includes a set of open-source tools mainly designed to explore the contents of an installed application on an Android device. Additionally, AEE offers a feature-rich APK/Split APKs/App bundle installer which allows users to pick and install files from device storage. <i>Please Note</i>: This is the full version of AEE.
